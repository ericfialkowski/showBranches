# Show Branches

This is a simple program that shows what the main/primary branch for a repo is and what the current checked out branch is.

Usage: 

```showBranches <dir> <dir> ...```

or if you only want to see directories where the local branch differs from the main branch: 

```showBranches -d <dir> <dir> ...```
